        <h2> Biography </h2>
        <p> Hey there! I'm Leland, a sophomore at Tufts University
            studying computer science. I love dancing, and you 
            can probably find me in Jackson Gym, Hill Aerobics,
            or just any quiet spot on campus practicing when I'm 
            not coding away. </p>
