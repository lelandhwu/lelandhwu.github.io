            Hi everyone, this is my first website ever so please
            have mercy on me. I literally just followed instructions on Mozilla Developer Network so most of this is just copy and paste but I hope that in the future I can revamp this website to demonstrate knowledge that I have gained over the years. I'm a student at Tufts University, an aspiring entrepreneur, teacher, and computer programmer. Here
            are a few of my goals for this summer:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li> Build a meaningful project </li>
            <li> Study for technical interviews </li>
            <li> Dance </li>
            <li> Perform well in my summer internship </li>
        </ul>
        <p> If you would like to know more about me and my  endeavors,
            check out my LinkedIn and Github. 
        </p>
